## Description
Codemaxxers is a web-based RPG game we made for Del Norte Highschool's APCSP, APCSA, and CSSE classes. Our goal was to make an interactive way that current and future classes could learn while having fun. We have a single-player mode that emphasizes our Pokemon inspired fight. Our multiplayer mode is meant for friends to prove who is the better coder.
